# Weather Dashboard

A weather dashboard for a 5-day forecast

## Description

I wanted to create a user friendly, clean-looking weather dashboard.  Something users can come to for local or non-local US weather which included a 5-day forecast.  This site helps create a space users can come to check out the weather at a quick glance and reconnect with saved searches.

I learned more about local storage and the benefits this type of storage has for basic and public information.  I learned how to utilize Bootstrap as a CSS framework for responsive and clean styling.  I intentionally focused on using jquery to learn the syntax.  

The biggest lesson I am walking away with is an appreciation for APIs and all that can be done with using this data.  While searching through the guide takes patience, it is worth taking the time to learn in order to gain access to such a large amount of data.  

## Installation

No installation required.  I recommend users save this URL to their bookmarks for quick access.

## Technology

This application was designed with Bootstrap CSS Framework, Google Font API, and Momentjs.  Weather data gathered from the OpenWeather API.  Built with HTML, CSS, and JQuery.

## Usage

The user can view the site at: https://rachlally.github.io/weather-dashboard/ .

To use, simply type a city of interest into the search bar and click "Search".  The user should see the current date, searched city, and current weather (including a weather icon, the temperature, wind speed, and humidity).  Below this, the user will see a 5-day forecast.  

The user will also notice their most recent searches will save under the search bar for an easy click to render results again.
